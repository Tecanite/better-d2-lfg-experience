## Configuration

this extension comes with an options page where all features can be individually configured.
the options page can be accessed either as a popup by left-clicking on the extensions icon or as a page by right-clicking the extention icon and choosing "options"

## Installation

- enable developer mode on chrome extension page (`<kbd>`Ctrl `</kbd>`+ `<kbd>`Shift `</kbd>` + `<kbd>`E `</kbd>` or [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) or under &#8942; )
- either drag the .crx onto the page or import the .zip as an unpacked extension
